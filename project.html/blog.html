        <h2>What is Farming?</h2>

        Rearing animals and planting crops for family consumption are some of the activities we usually term “Farming”. But to make it clear, Farming goes beyond these two. Farming is the basis of agriculture.
        <br>
        The raw materials used in the production of different finished products are all generated through farming. Some of these raw materials include cotton, timber, cocoa, wheat, coffee, palm oil, and others. This is to say that on a large scale, farming can be defined as a business aimed at producing raw materials for personal, industrial, and commercial purposes.
        Is Farming in Nigeria Profitable?
        <br>
        One thing every household cannot do without is food. This is a basic need of man and If the essence of farming is to end hunger, then it can be termed profitable. This is because you can make money from farming by selling your farm produce to individuals or organizations who need various farm products.
        
        Farming when done right is profitable. But, like every other venture, money, time and resources must be invested to get high returns.
